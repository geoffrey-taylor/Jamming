# Spotify Web API Framework  

Prototype with all component logic and rendering complete.  
User searches Spotify for songs by title.  `Web API` returns results in browser.  
User can select songs to add to a new custom playlist, then save that playlist to their Spotify account.  
  
Not officially registered with Spotify Apps, so no `clientId` or functional permissions.  
Uses `JavaScript`, `React`, and `Vite` development. No `CSS` styling for each component.  
  
**Heavily** assisted by Codecademy project solution.
